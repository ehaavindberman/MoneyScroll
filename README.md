# MoneyScroll
MoneyScroll is the first JavaScript project I ever worked on. The idea is simple, put in your salary or hourly wage and watch the money roll in!

In the MoneyScroll folder, I have included assets that have US coins, Norwegian Kroner, and Snickers bars along with some backgrounds for the canvas.

This project was heavily inspired by Daniel Shiffman at [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/) 

The project utilizes object oriented programming where each coin is an instance of a scrollingMoney object, whose values are called from JSON data in the JS file.

To view an instance of the code being used in real time visit http://www.haavindberman.com/MoneyScroll.html and watch the cash roll in!
